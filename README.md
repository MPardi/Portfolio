# The Porfolio of Michael Pardi

#### This repository contains examples of programming projects and assignments I've worked on. 

#### The orgnaization is based around the langauge/development environment.

#### __*Overview:*__

| Catagory        | Description |
| ------------- |-------------|
| Arduino   | Projects that utilized the Arduino environment and microcontrollers|
| Java    | Projects using the Java Programming language    |
| Python | Projects using Python and a multitude of libraries   |
| Swift	| Projects using Swift to develop iOS apps|
| Web Development | Projects using NodeJS/Javascript/HTML/CSS	|

#### __*Instructions for running these projects:*__

##### Arduino:
- Includes a project I made that allows you to wind wire onto a spool using a footswitch, this was done to create solenoids for a larger pinball machine project.		
- Instructions:
	- `Just compile and upload to a Teensy or Arduino using Arduino IDE`
##### Java:
- Quiz Applet: A larger GUI project, using Swing to create a quiz applet. 
- Athlete Database (Console): A console application for adding and keeping track of athletes in a database.
- Athlete Medal Applet: A GUI version of the 'Athlete Database (Console)' program. Uses Swing for GUI widgets. 
- Instructions:
	- `Compile with Java`
##### Python:
- Password Cracker: An attempt to make a brute-force password guessing tool. Just for fun :). Displays in terminal only, tried to make it look hacker cool.
- phpMyFAQ Webscrape: This is a program that uses BeautifulSoup to scrape data from phpMyFAQ sites. This specific example is aimed at an investor Q&A website that contains hundreds of questions and answers. This will get the data and then export it to a .csv file that can be opened in Excel.
- Reddit Video Downloader: A program that allows a user to download the newest 'Hot' videos off of Reddits /r/videos subreddit. This program makes use of the PRAW library, which allows you to create a user instance and browse Reddit through Python scripts. Originally intended to be a bot, but became a testbed. Program also makes use of Youtube-DL, a command-line tool that allows users to download YouTube videos using CLI commands. 
- Instructions:
	- Password Cracker:
		- `python3 passwordCracker.py`
	- phpMyFAQ Webscrape and Reddit Video Downloader:
		- ```
			virtualenv project_name
			pip3 install -r requirements.txt
			python3 project_name.py
		```  
##### Swift:

##### Web Development:
